<p>I recently found Hyrox when i was released from prison while i was away i trained in crossfit and found that i loved what i got out of it mentaly and psyically i loved to sweat and if you like this then this is for you and you can start by following my hyrox workout below.</p>

<p><h5><i> Its inportant to know this before you start and that is it dont matter how long it takes you to do this make sure you finish and '<mark>'make sure you have '<strong>'WATER'</strong> with you before you start.'</mark>'
    so how this works is that you run a 1km then do a exercise lets say burpees then you go back to the run of 1km again then to a different exercise lets say ball slams
    and you continue this till you have conpleted everything 8 times this will mean you hav run 8km and done a good amount of reps on the exercise side of things good
    and ,ake sure you sweat and drinl water
</i></h5></p>

    <i>You can do what ever amount of reps you choose on the exercises but i suggest you start with 20 reps each and with the push and pull start with 50 meters you can 
        alaways work up to the numbers you want and you dont want to do a injury on your first go.
    '<mark>'remember to drink '<strong>WATER</strong> and maybe have some '<strong>'JELLYBEANS</strong> there for when you finish because you blood sugars will be low after a workout of this type'</mark> good luck and 
    learn to love the burn </i>
